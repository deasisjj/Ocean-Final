# Ocean-Final

Project Description:

Because of climate change, the ice bergs are starting to melt, obviously, the temperature of the surface of the ocean nearby the ice bergs are decreasing. This project is made to study the rate of change of ocean temperature through the years specifically to the ocean parts where there are ice bergs nearby (in this case, I picked the Irminger Sea). We all know that the temperature of the surface of these waters are going to decrease but we don't know if how deep does the temperature change can reach. That's why I picked the deepest CTD instrument that was deployed in this area (1500m). The best way analyze the data, is to start at when the instrument was deployed (September 2014) and end this year's month which is March 2019. Using Python Programming, I graphed the data from 2014-2016, 2016-2017, and 2017-2019. This gave me a graphical information of the temperature changes. 


How to acquire the data:
Link to the Instrument/Data: https://ooinet.oceanobservatories.org/data_access/?search=GI01SUMO-RII11-02-CTDMOR020
This data is collected from the Ocean Observatories Initiative website. To locate the data:
1. Go to the Ocean Observatories Initiative website
2. Hover over the "The Observatory" tab and hover over the "Research Array" tab and click Global Irminger Sea.
3. Click on Apex Surface Mooring (GI01SUMO)then click on the GI01SUMO-RII11-02-CTDMOR020 instrument at the bottom of the      page.
4. The data used on this project will be the first data from this instrument. 
5. To download the data, log-in/create an account.
6. Put the time range of the data that you want and click download.
7. You will then be sent an email containing the data and you can pick on what kind of file you want it to be. In this case, I wanted it to be a .csv file. 
8. Information about the data:
   Global Irminger Sea
   Site name - Apex Surface Mooring
   Water depth - 2800 meters
   Instrument - GI01SUMO-RII11-02-CTDMOR020

   Make model = Sea-Bird - SBE 37IM
   Node = mooring riser


How to find open the code using colab.research.google.com:
1. Download the code
2. Use colab.research.google.com to open the code
3. Log-in google account to get the password for the code
4. Run the first cell in the code and enter the password
5. Run the second cell to get graphs
6. The datas must be on your google drive in order to run the code. I uploaded the files here in my GitHub titled "OceanDataFInals"
